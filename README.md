### üöÄ Getting Started

To run the KSEB Bill Tracker locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL_HERE]
    cd kseb-bill-tracker
    ```
2.  **Backend Setup (Python/Flask):**
    * Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8+).
    * Install the necessary Python packages:
        ```bash
        pip install Flask python-dotenv firebase-admin
        ```
    * **Firebase Configuration:**
        * Create a Firebase project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
        * Generate a Firebase service account key file (usually `firebase_credentials.json`) and place it in your Flask application's root directory.
        * (Optional but Recommended): Set up environment variables for your Firebase client-side API keys in a `.env` file, and load them in your Flask `app.py`. Alternatively, ensure your client-side keys are correctly placed in `script.js` (as per previous instructions).
    * Run the Flask application:
        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```
        (Your Flask app will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`)

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    * The frontend uses standard HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS via CDN), and JavaScript.
    * Ensure `index.html` is in your Flask `templates` directory (or served directly if not using templates), and `script.js` is in your `static` folder.

4.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the address where your Flask server is running (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000`).
