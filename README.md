⚡ KSEB Bill Tracker: Your Smart Electricity Companion 🏡
Welcome to the KSEB Bill Tracker, a personal web application designed to help KSEB consumers in Kerala, India, effortlessly monitor their electricity consumption and get estimated bill calculations. Say goodbye to bill surprises! 👋
This project is a full-stack application built with Flask (Python) for the backend and a modern JavaScript frontend powered by Firebase for data persistence.
✨ Features
 * ⚡ Daily Meter Readings: Easily log your daily electricity meter readings.
 * 📊 Real-time Estimated Bill: Get an instant, accurate estimate of your current bi-monthly bill based on your accumulated readings.
 * 🗓️ Bill Cycle Tracking: Automatically tracks your current bi-monthly billing cycle.
 * 💸 Official Bill Finalization: Record your actual official KSEB bills for historical tracking.
 * 📈 Bill Comparison: See how your current estimated bill compares to your past bi-monthly averages.
 * 🔒 Secure Data Storage: Your reading data is securely stored in Google Firebase Firestore.
⚠️ Important Note on Tariff Calculation
This application's bill calculation logic is **strictly based on the publicly available tariff details provided on https://bills.kseb.in/ for the Domestic (LT-IA) consumer category only. It currently does not support other tariff categories or special rates. Future updates may include support for additional tariff types if required. Please refer to official KSEB sources for definitive bill amounts.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend
 * HTML5: For structuring the web content.
 * CSS (Tailwind CSS): For rapid and responsive UI design.
 * JavaScript: For all client-side logic, interactivity, and dynamic updates.
 * Firebase SDK: For real-time data storage (Firestore) and user authentication (Auth).
Backend
 * Python: The core programming language.
 * Flask: A lightweight Python web framework for handling API requests and serving the frontend.
 * calculations.py: A dedicated module for precise KSEB tariff calculations.
🚀 Getting Started
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:
Prerequisites
 * Python 3.x installed.
 * pip (Python package installer).
 * A Firebase Project set up with Firestore enabled and Web App configured. You'll need its apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.
 * Git installed on your system.
Installation & Setup
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/AkzXrated/KSEB_BILL_TRACKER_APP.git
cd KSEB_BILL_TRACKER_APP

 * Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   * Linux/macOS:
     python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

   * Windows:
     python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

 * Install backend dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

 * Configure Firebase:
   * Open app.py.
   * Locate the FIREBASE_CONFIG dictionary.
   * Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project's web app configuration details.
     FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
  "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "authDomain": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  "projectId": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  "storageBucket": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  "messagingSenderId": "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  "appId": "YOUR_APP_ID",
  "measurementId": "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
}

   * Note: These are client-side public keys and are safe to be in your code. Ensure your Firebase Firestore Security Rules are set up to properly secure user data (e.g., allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;).
 * Run the Flask backend server:
   flask run
# Or simply: python app.py (if you prefer)

   The server will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
 * Open in your browser:
   Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.
💡 How to Use
 * Add Daily Readings: On the main interface, input your current meter reading and the date. Click "Add Reading."
 * View Estimated Bill: The system will automatically calculate and display your estimated bill for the current bi-monthly cycle.
 * Finalize Official Bill: When your official KSEB bill arrives, enter the end date of that bill cycle and the actual amount. This helps track your historical spending and provides a basis for comparison.
 * Bill Comparison: See how your estimated and actual bills stack up against your historical averages.
