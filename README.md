Welcome to the **KSEB Bill Tracker**, a personal web application designed to help KSEB consumers in Kerala, India, effortlessly monitor their electricity consumption and get estimated bill calculations. Say goodbye to bill surprises! üëã

This project is a full-stack application built with Flask (Python) for the backend and a modern JavaScript frontend powered by Firebase for data persistence.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Tariff Calculation

This application's bill calculation logic is **strictly based on the publicly available tariff details provided on [https://bills.kseb.in/](https://bills.kseb.in/) for the **Domestic (LT-IA) consumer category only**. It currently **does not support** other tariff categories or special rates. Future updates may include support for additional tariff types if required. Please refer to official KSEB sources for definitive bill amounts.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed.
* `pip` (Python package installer).
* A Firebase Project set up with Firestore enabled and Web App configured. You'll need its `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, etc.
* Git installed on your system.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AkzXrated/KSEB_BILL_TRACKER_APP.git](https://github.com/AkzXrated/KSEB_BILL_TRACKER_APP.git)
    cd KSEB_BILL_TRACKER_APP
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    * **Linux/macOS:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Firebase:**
    * Open `app.py`.
    * Locate the `FIREBASE_CONFIG` dictionary.
    * Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project's web app configuration details.
        ```python
        FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
          "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
          "authDomain": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
          "projectId": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          "storageBucket": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
          "messagingSenderId": "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
          "appId": "YOUR_APP_ID",
          "measurementId": "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
        }
        ```
    * **Note:** These are client-side public keys and are safe to be in your code. Ensure your Firebase Firestore Security Rules are set up to properly secure user data (e.g., `allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;`).

5.  **Run the Flask backend server:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    # Or simply: python app.py (if you prefer)
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

6.  **Open in your browser:**
    Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

## üí° How to Use

1.  **Add Daily Readings:** On the main interface, input your current meter reading and the date. Click "Add Reading."
2.  **View Estimated Bill:** The system will automatically calculate and display your estimated bill for the current bi-monthly cycle.
3.  **Finalize Official Bill:** When your official KSEB bill arrives, enter the end date of that bill cycle and the actual amount. This helps track your historical spending and provides a basis for comparison.
4.  **Bill Comparison:** See how your estimated and actual bills stack up against your historical averages.

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Plans & Roadmap

We have exciting plans to enhance the KSEB Bill Tracker! Here's a glimpse of what's coming:

* **Graphical Usage Analytics:** üìà Implement charts and graphs to visualize daily, weekly, and monthly electricity consumption trends. This will provide deeper insights into usage patterns.
* **Daily Consumption Warnings:** üîî Develop smart alerts that notify users if their daily consumption puts them on track to exceed specific slab limits, helping them manage usage proactively.
* **Predictive Bill Forecasting:** üîÆ Utilize historical data to predict future bill amounts more accurately based on ongoing consumption trends.
* **User Accounts & Profiles:** üë§ Allow users to create dedicated accounts to manage their data more robustly (currently uses anonymous Firebase auth, which will be maintained for simplicity until a more robust system is needed).
* **Multiple Meter Support:** üè° Feature to track consumption for more than one electricity meter.
* **Notification System:** üìß SMS/Email reminders for meter reading submission or bill finalization.
