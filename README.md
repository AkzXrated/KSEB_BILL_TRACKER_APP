Welcome to the **KSEB Bill Tracker**, a personal web application designed to help KSEB consumers in Kerala, India, effortlessly monitor their electricity consumption and get estimated bill calculations. Say goodbye to bill surprises\! üëã

This project is a full-stack application built with Flask (Python) for the backend and a modern JavaScript frontend powered by Firebase for data persistence.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **‚ö° Daily Meter Readings:** Easily log your daily electricity meter readings.
  * **üìä Real-time Estimated Bill:** Get an instant, accurate estimate of your current bi-monthly bill based on your accumulated readings.
  * **üóìÔ∏è Bill Cycle Tracking:** Automatically tracks your current bi-monthly billing cycle.
  * **üí∏ Official Bill Finalization:** Record your actual official KSEB bills for historical tracking.
  * **üìà Bill Comparison:** See how your current estimated bill compares to your past bi-monthly averages.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Tariff Calculation

This application's bill calculation logic is \*\*strictly based on the publicly available tariff details provided on [https://bills.kseb.in/](https://bills.kseb.in/) for the **Domestic (LT-IA) consumer category only**. It currently **does not support** other tariff categories or special rates. Future updates may include support for additional tariff types if required. Please refer to official KSEB sources for definitive bill amounts.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.x installed.
  * `pip` (Python package installer).
  * A Firebase Project set up with Firestore enabled and Web App configured. You'll need its `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, etc.
  * Git installed on your system.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AkzXrated/KSEB_BILL_TRACKER_APP.git
    cd KSEB_BILL_TRACKER_APP
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**

      * **Linux/macOS:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
      * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Firebase:**

      * Open `app.py`.
      * Locate the `FIREBASE_CONFIG` dictionary.
      * Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project's web app configuration details.
        ```python
        FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
          "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
          "authDomain": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
          "projectId": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          "storageBucket": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
          "messagingSenderId": "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
          "appId": "YOUR_APP_ID",
          "measurementId": "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
        }
        ```
      * **Note:** These are client-side public keys and are safe to be in your code. Ensure your Firebase Firestore Security Rules are set up to properly secure user data (e.g., `allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;`).

5.  **Run the Flask backend server:**

    ```bash
    flask run
    # Or simply: python app.py (if you prefer)
    ```

    The server will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

6.  **Open in your browser:**
    Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

## üí° How to Use

1.  **Add Daily Readings:** On the main interface, input your current meter reading and the date. Click "Add Reading."
2.  **View Estimated Bill:** The system will automatically calculate and display your estimated bill for the current bi-monthly cycle.
3.  **Finalize Official Bill:** When your official KSEB bill arrives, enter the end date of that bill cycle and the actual amount. This helps track your historical spending and provides a basis for comparison.
4.  **Bill Comparison:** See how your estimated and actual bills stack up against your historical averages.

## üìä KSEB Tariff Structure (Domestic - LT-IA)

The `calculations.py` module accurately implements the bi-monthly (60-day) tariff structure for domestic consumers in Kerala, based on current KSERC regulations (as of last update).

### Fixed Charges (FC)

| Consumption Slab (Bi-monthly Units) | Fixed Charge (‚Çπ) |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| 0 - 100                             | 99.50            |
| 101 - 200                           | 169.00           |
| 201 - 300                           | 209.00           |
| 301 - 400                           | 279.00           |

| 801+                                | 568.00           |

### Energy Charges (EC) Per Unit

#### Telescopic Slabs (for consumption up to 500 units bi-monthly)

| Units in Slab         | Rate (‚Çπ/unit) |
| :-------------------- | :------------ |
| First 100             | 3.35 |
| Next 100 (Upto 200)   | 4.25 |
| Next 100 (Upto 300)   | 5.35 |
| Next 100 (Upto 400)   | 7.20 |
| Next 100 (Upto 500)   | 8.50 |

#### Non-Telescopic Rates (if total consumption exceeds 500 units bi-monthly)

| Consumption Slab (Bi-monthly Units) | Rate (‚Çπ/unit) |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------ |
| 501 - 600                           | 6.75          |
| 601 - 800                           | 7.95          |
| 801+                                | 8.25          |

### Other Charges/Subsidies (Bi-monthly)

  * **Electricity Duty:** 10% on Fixed Charge + Energy Charge
  * **Fuel Surcharge:** ‚Çπ0.08 per unit
  * **Meter Rent:** ‚Çπ12.00
  * **FC Subsidy:** -‚Çπ40.00 for consumption $\\le$ 300 units (otherwise ‚Çπ0.00)
  * **EC Subsidy:** Varies based on consumption (e.g., -‚Çπ6.00 for $\\le$ 44 units, up to -‚Çπ108.00 for $\\le$ 240 units, then ‚Çπ0.00 or complex for higher slabs). *Please refer to `calculations.py` for detailed subsidy logic.*
